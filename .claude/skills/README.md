## Skills

| Skill | Invoke | Description |
|---|---|---|
| [`higgsfield-generate`](./higgsfield-generate) | `/higgsfield:generate` | Image, video, 3D, and audio generation across 30+ models (Nano Banana 2, Soul V2, Veo 3.1, Kling 3.0, Seedance 2.0, Seed Audio 1.0, Flux 2, GPT Image 2, …), plus Marketing Studio for branded ads with avatars/products/hooks/settings and Virality Predictor scoring for finished videos. |
| [`higgsfield-soul-id`](./higgsfield-soul-id) | `/higgsfield:soul-id` | Train a Soul Character — a reusable, face-faithful identity model. Returns a `reference_id` consumable by Soul-aware generation. |
| [`higgsfield-product-photoshoot`](./higgsfield-product-photoshoot) | `/higgsfield:product-photoshoot` | Brand-quality product imagery with mode-specific prompt enhancement. 10 modes (studio, lifestyle, Pinterest, hero banner, ad packs, virtual try-on, …) backed by `gpt_image_2`. |
| [`higgsfield-marketplace-cards`](./higgsfield-marketplace-cards) | `/higgsfield:marketplace-cards` | Marketplace product cards: compliant main image, secondary product images, and A+ style modules via backend prompt enhancement. |
| [`higgsfield-websites`](./higgsfield-websites) | `/higgsfield:websites` | Build, edit, and deploy full-stack websites — React 19 + TanStack Start, server-rendered as one Cloudflare Worker with D1 / R2 / KV / Durable Objects / Containers. Create → get git repo access → edit locally → push → deploy preview/production, all via `higgsfield website …`. |
| [`higgsfield-video-explainer`](./higgsfield-video-explainer) | `/higgsfield:video-explainer` | Create a narrated non-photoreal explainer as matched Seed Audio + Gemini Omni blocks, then assemble the final MP4 with `explainer_video`. |
| [`higgsfield-game-generation`](./higgsfield-game-generation) | `/higgsfield:game-generation` | Plan, build, verify, and deploy playable browser games, or generate game-specific sprites, textures, rigged 3D assets, and audio. |

The skills chain: train Soul → use the reference id in `generate` (including Marketing Studio jobs). `product-photoshoot` and `marketplace-cards` are self-contained — backend enhances prompts before submitting image jobs. `websites` chains with `generate` to embed bespoke hero images, video loops, and OG assets in the site.
